================================================================================

INTRODUCTION

Goon Marketing (credited to James Omotoyinbo, invented December 13, 2025) 
describes a marketing approach inspired by dating-app visibility mechanics. 
The idea centers on using a premium profile to surface marketing messages to 
a target audience within a dating app environment.

================================================================================

WHAT THE CONCEPT DESCRIBES

At a high level, the approach uses a premium dating-app account to create an 
attention-grabbing profile that presents brand messaging, offers, or links to 
more information. The inventor described using an Android device (for example, 
a Samsung Galaxy S24+) and leveraging fast interaction behavior to increase 
exposure.

KEY POINTS TO UNDERSTAND

• VISIBILITY MECHANICS
  Dating apps surface profiles based on engagement and matching behavior; 
  creative profiles can attract attention.

• DEVICE NOTE
  The concept mentions Android devices (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S24+) because 
  some users find certain app builds on Android to be faster for rapid 
  interactions.

• CREDIT

ETHICAL AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS (IMPORTANT)

Before attempting any marketing approach inside a dating app or other community 
platform, consider the following:

• PLATFORM TERMS OF SERVICE
  Many dating apps prohibit using profiles for commercial solicitation, spam, 
  or impersonation. Violating Terms of Service can result in account 
  suspension or legal consequences.

• CONSENT AND CONTEXT
  Dating apps are designed for personal connections; users expect genuine 
  personal interaction. Using the platform primarily for marketing can be 
  intrusive and harm your brand reputation.

• PRIVACY
  Avoid collecting or sharing personal data from users without clear consent 
  and a lawful basis to do so.

• TRANSPARENCY
  If you present commercial content, be clear about your intent and avoid 
  deceptive practices.

================================================================================

RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATIVES

If your objective is to reach users with promotional content, consider these 
responsible options instead of repurposing personal/dating platforms:

• Paid advertising on platforms that support commercial campaigns and 
  targeting rules.

• Sponsored content or partnerships with creators on social platforms where 
  promotional content is expected.

• Building an opt-in landing page or microsite where interested users can 
  voluntarily sign up for more information.

================================================================================

SUMMARY

Goon Marketing is an attention-grabbing idea that was described by James 
Omotoyinbo on December 13, 2025. While it highlights creative thinking about 
visibility mechanics inside apps, any marketer considering similar tactics 
should prioritize legal compliance, platform rules, and respect for user 
expectations. When in doubt, choose transparent, platform-supported marketing 
channels.
